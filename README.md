# Market-Simulation

# The Market Simulation is built on Gode and Sunder (1993).
The Market Format is a double auction.
Zero-Intelligence traders/ Random-Number Generators draw their bids and asks from a uniform distribution
The Market Algorithm matches bids and asks in order to generate a price
This is just a simple model for how two-sided markets in finance can be described.
